=============
MANAGING DOWNLOADED CONTAINERS

- run 'docker ps -a' to find list of all previously run containers
- find the name of the one you want to use
- run 'docker start container_name'
- run 'docker attach container_name'


so if you run an image
you create a container
that container holds the information of the session
but the image is preserved for distribution
if you want to check your containers
do
docker ps -a
and you should have a huuuuuge list of exited (or running) containers
to remove any that you dont need
docker rm <container name>

======
RUNNING JUPYTER IN A GOOGLE CLOUD IN A DOCKER

on the google cloud
instead of running alee156/clviz:0
run alee156/clviz:jupyter
run -t -i -p 80:80 alee156/clviz:jupyter

its alee156/clviz:jupyter1
run -t -i -p 80:80 alee156/clviz:jupyter1
you can call 'jupyter notebook' in the container and open the notebook by going to the server's ip address
104.155.167.35
